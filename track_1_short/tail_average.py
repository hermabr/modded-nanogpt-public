"""Tail averaging (record #360): the run ends on a blend of late-training weight averages
instead of the raw final iterate.

Four accumulators track the last hundred or so steps (record #360's windows, scaled from its 1194
steps to this run's 570). Each rank averages only the shard of each
weight it owns in the optimizer (1/8 of the weights), in fp32. At the end of training, before the
final validation, each accumulator is "shipped": written back into its weights, then every shipped
weight is all-gathered and rescaled to its pre-ship Frobenius norm ("decontraction": averaging
shrinks norms, and the model was trained at the un-averaged scale).

  accumulator         weights              ticks                          ship
  tail-ema            lm_head, embed       Adam steps, last 142           lerp(final, ema, 0.65)
  tail-avg            vo_bank, mlp_bank    every 4th step, last 119       replaced by the average
  value-embed-avg     value_embeds         its update events, last 119    replaced by the average
  bank-blend          qk/vo/mlp banks      every 4th step, last 142       lerp(current, ema, B)

bank-blend ships last, so on vo/mlp it blends into the tail average. Its B is 0.55, lowered by a
Richardson correction on vo/mlp: a seeded EMA lags the final iterate, and
(1-B)*A + B*X + w*(A - X) == lerp(A, X, B - w).
